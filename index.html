                All this day, the 2nd of April, the deck was deserted, even the saloons were empty, 
                for the passengers had taken refuge in their cabins,
                and two-thirds of the guests were missing at lunch and dinner. Whist was impossible, 
                for the tables glided from under the players' hands. The chess-men were unmanageable.
